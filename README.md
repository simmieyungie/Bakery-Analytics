# Bakery-Analytics
A certain bakery needs to understand its sales pattern and also conduct a market analysis.

## EDA
An extensive Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted on the Dataset. Using the 80/20 rule, results showed that the rule is valid for the sales of the organization. 

## Tools
R and Python were both leveraged to assess the wealth of insights waiting to be mined in this dataset. The reticulate package was employed which allowed the use of both R and Python in the same Markdown file.

## Presentation
The final dashboard was rendered in Power BI for presentation to the stakeholders to aid their decision making process.
